Trying new ideas


A small game(for now) that I want to evolve into a playable magnum opus.


# Controls

A, LeftArrow - Left

D, RightArrow - Right

W, Space, UpArrow - Jump

For controller:

D-padLeft, RightJoystickLeft - Left

D-padRight, RightJoystickRight - Right

D-padUp, A button - Jump

Double-jump can be engaged while in air by pressing the Jump button!

Wall-jump can pe engaged after jumping on a wall and on contact with the wall press the Left or Right key to jump in the desired direction.


# How to complete the game

To finish a level you need to collect all the Intels in said level, after which a Level Completed! screen will be displayed. Beware of traps...and others!

Good luck and have fun!
